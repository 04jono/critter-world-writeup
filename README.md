## Implementation

Approximately 8000 lines of code were written from scratch.

Our first task was to design and implement a recursive descent parser for the grammar of a "critter" programming language specified in the project spec below.

We then had to develop an interpreter for the critter programming language. These interpreted programs defined the behavior of critters in a simulated world. 

Finally, we designed a modern GUI in JavaFX to allow the user to interact with the world. Features included zooming, panning, and intuitive controls for clicking on critters and fast-forwarding the world simulation.

In all, we implemented a simple interpreted programming language, and developed a modern and user-friendly UI for the game based on the critter language.
